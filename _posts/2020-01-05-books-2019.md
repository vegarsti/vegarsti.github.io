title: Books I read in 2019
---

This year I read 40 books, surpassing my goal of 30 ([see my year in books on Goodreads](https://t.co/ybVQTLo7Qn?amp=1)).
I'm pleasantly surprised at how much reading it's possible to get in, just by reading when commuting and in various idle windows during the afternoon.
[Last year I read 5k pages over 16 books](/books-2018), whereas this year I read 12k.
Below is a list of the books I read.
Those in bold are especially recommended, either because they were particularly enjoying or interesting.
